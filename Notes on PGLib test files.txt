Notes on PGLib test files:

struct named mpc with different attributes: 

    baseMVA - float
    bus - matrix
    branch - matrix
    gen - matrix


*** any columns named in this file should be written to csv file. Some of them we definitely need, some of them we only need 
    if we are going to implement certain features, and some of them I do not know if we need yet

*** for bus, gen, and branch, combine multiple cases into 1 csv file. Not sure which cases to use yet but lets start with 3, 10, 100

*** for gencost, each case gets its own csv file to avoid issues with different numbers of gen cost curve data points. 


bus columns:

    bus_i : bus number (NEED)
    type: 1 = PQ, 2 = PV, 3 = ref, 4 = isolated
        **not sure about meaning of PQ and PV. Should just be one reference bus per case. 
    Pd : real power demand (NEED)
    Qd : reactive power demand (not sure)
    area : bus area (not sure)

gen:

    bus : bus number (NEED)
    Pg : real power output (not sure)
    status : machine in/out of service (NEED)
    Pmax : maximum real power output (NEED)
    Pmin : minimum real power output (NEED for unit commitment)

gencost: 

    cost model : 1 or 2, 1 is piecewise linear, 2 is polynomial (NEED for gen cost structure)
    startup : startup cost (NEED maybe depending on cost modeling)
    shutdown : shutdown cost (NEED maybe depending on cost modeling)
    n : number of data points for cost model (NEED)
    c(n), c(n-1), c(0) : cost model data points

    ** this could be a bit tricky because n can change between generators and cases. 
       we definitely need this for the benchmarking though
       I would suggest not combining more than 1 case for this file

branch:
    fbus  : "from" bus (NEED)
    tbus  : "to" bus (NEED)
    r     : resistance (not sure, grab)
    x     : reactance (NEED)
    b     : total line charging susceptance (not sure, grab)
    rateA : MVA long-term rating (NEED) 
        ** set to 0 for unlimited rating!!
    rateb : MVA short-term rating (not sure, grab)
    ratec : MVA emergency rating (not sure, grab) 
    ratio : transformer ratio, 0 for transmission line (not sure, grab)
    angle : transformer angle shift (not sure, grab)
    status: 1 = in service, 0 = not in service (NEED)
    angmin: minimum angle difference in degrees (not sure, grab)
    angmax: maximum angle difference in degrees (not sure, grab)
